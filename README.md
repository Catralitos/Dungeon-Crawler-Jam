# Dungeon Crawler Jam

Labyrinth of Death is a first-person survival-horror dungeon-crawler where the player must explore a haunted mansion and its horrific dimensional parallel, to find ammo and clues to solve puzzles and survive the onslaught of zombies.

This was made for the Dungeon Crawler Jam 2023, where the team was Duality. This got us thinking of Silent Hill and Stranger Things, and our love of Resident Evil ultimately took us to this survival horror twist on the genre.

Unfortunately, we had no artist, and we were doing a very big project, so we felt short in a lot of ways, but the project is one we still think fondly of.
